<h1 align="center">Announcing Hackers Nightlight V2</h1>

<p align="center">Hackers nightlight V2 is inspired by the open source project's idea of creating a covert penetration testing tool to help uncover hardware vulnerabilities, test network security and response readiness. </p>

<p align="center">Hackers nightlight V2 brings new custom hardware packed inside of the same discrete light bulb format, containing a brand new webUI with focus on ease of use, and a suite of new abilities and tools.  </p>

the Wi-Fi hacking light bulb ( More models coming soon )


# Context

The Hacker night light project is meant to show the attack possibilities and vulnerabilities with smart light bulbs.


WiFi-connected smart lights are modern lighting solutions that you can control with your phone or voice commands. They work by connecting to your home WiFi network, allowing you to adjust them remotely. You can change the brightness, color, and even set schedules for when they turn on or off. They're easy to install and can be used in various forms like bulbs or light strips. Plus, they help save energy and add convenience to your home by letting you customize your lighting preferences easily.


lights often use simple WiFi-enabled microcontrollers to manage connections and control the LED arrays. These microcontrollers are like tiny computers embedded within the smart light system. They handle tasks such as connecting to your home WiFi network, communicating with your smartphone or other devices, and controlling the LEDs

Different models of lights will use different microcontrollers for these operations. Certain microcontrollers possess the capability to perform WiFi network penetration or exploitation.
One model is the ESP32-C3. Capability of doing such this such as 

* PMKID capture
* Deauthentication attacks using various methods
* WPA/WPA2 handshake capture and parsing
* Passive handshake sniffing
* Packet sniffing

With many open source firmwares public on github such as https://github.com/risinek/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool

# Vont Smartlight Pros

Searching Amazon endless for models using ESP32 chips within their hardware I stumbled upon Vonts Smart Light Pro. 

the 3 models vulnerable to this are Vont Color Pro SLB04, Vont Color SLB02 and Vont Color SLB01 (More to come)

This model of smart light specifically uses a ESP32-C3 with 4 MB of flash.

Using these GPIO pins for light control: 

* GPIO03    PWM_i 5    Warm White
* GPIO04    PWM 4    Cool White
* GPIO05    PWM 3    Blue
* GPIO06    PWM 1    Red
* GPIO07    PWM 2    Green

Tearing into the light bulb reveals UART copper pads allowing someone to easily soder and access the ESP32-C3 via UART on the PCB


![Untitled-1](https://github.com/Peaakss/Hacker-Nightlight/assets/115900893/e68fed69-ae99-4fa5-ab37-bb71a288bb7b)



By leveraging the appropriate firmware, an attacker can readily implant a backdoor using the ESP32-C3 chip, enabling remote connectivity to the PCB for executing attacks or packet sniffing, all while maintaining the appearance and functionality of a typical Smart Light bulb.



(Vont has went out of business and no longer sells smart home application or this model of lightbulb)

# Soldering Uart connections

Using a $7 USB to TTL on amazon we can connect the TX to RX together on the TTL USB while also grounding IO9 on the light bulb PCB, setting the ESP32-C3 into boot loader mode from there we can flash our new firmware. Once the chip is flashed, unground IO9 and power cycle and the ESP will reboot into the newly flashed firmware

Once connected we are able to read and write to the flash

# Flashing 

Donwload the Flashtool from https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools 

DO NOT FLASH WHILE OR PLUG IN USB ADAPTER WHILE LIGHTBULB IS ON 120V or 240V POWER SOURCE!!! 

when opening the flashtool, you will want to set Chiptype to ESP32-C3 and make sure WorkMode is on Develop and LoadMode is on UART

Once loaded, set the values as follows 

1. bootloader.bin @ 0x0
2. partitions.bin @ 0x8000
3. firmware.bin @ 0x10000

Ensure your SPI mode is set to QIO and baud rate is at 115200

# After flashing

once you flash the ESP32-C3 you will want to remove you will want to unpower the device and remove it from bootloader, once you have done that you can either 

1. plug in the USB to UART (LED array will not be on)
2. remove UART cables from USB and plug light into E26 socket (lamp or light socket)

**DEFAULT SSID:** Nightlight

**DEFAULT Password:** Nightlight12345

from there you will want to connect to the Nightlight AP using the Password "Nightlight12345" then navigate to the web page hosted on 192.168.4.1

to change light colors scroll down to the light control page

Click the box, this is give you a color picker to select a RGB code for the light

YOU CANNOT HAVE RBG AND WARM/COLD LIGHTS ON AT THE SAME TIME, if you move the warm/cold slider it will turn on the warm/cold lights, to turn RBG back on slide it back and the RBG will turn back on

# Wyze Bulb Color (WLPA19CV2) 

The Wyze bulb colors use the exact same MCU as the vont color lights. ESP32-C3, however have a diffrent flashing process.

![IMG_1663](https://github.com/hak5peaks/Hackers-Nightlight/assets/115900893/f475e295-e994-411f-8fcc-7a32f0029c96)

rather then grounding a single GPIO pin to set the chip into boot loader, these bulbs require that GPIO8 needs to be set to high (jump to 3.3v) and GPIO9 needs to be grounded

```
GPIO8 -> HIGH
GPIO9 -> LOW
```

Flash process remains the same.

## THESE LIGHTS USE BP5758 LED DRIVER, FULL LED CONTROL FROM THE WEB SERVER IS STILL WIP.
